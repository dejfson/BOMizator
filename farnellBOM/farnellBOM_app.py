"""
This application takes as the input the CSV bill-of-material file
generated by KiCad PCBNEW tool. It displays all the components in the
table. By clicking on read-only table items (value, manufacturer,
footprint) a default browser is launched, which searches for a
clicked keyword on the pages of farnell. This can be used to fast
search the farnell ordering codes. The application supports drag-drop
functionality, hence if user selects the farnell ordering code, it can
be dragged to the application to a specific column. This is a
hack-style tool, which allows the PCB designer to quickly search for
manufacturer part independently of the values of the libraries.
